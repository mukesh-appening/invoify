## UX Analysis

*UX analysis data is also available as raw JSON in `ux-analysis.json` in this directory.*

### Emotional Journey

This analysis describes the user's emotional experience throughout the test execution, highlighting moments of confidence, frustration, and satisfaction.

> User starts confident (site loads, logo visible). Slight impatience arises when Live Preview lags before reflecting name/address. Major frustration hits when visual cue of default tab is missing—user questions whether they are on the right step. Confidence crashes when newly-added custom data never appears in the preview, making the feature feel broken. Deleting a custom field works, offering mild relief but overall trust in the editor is dented.

### Step-by-Step Narrative

Detailed breakdown of each test step with status and key observations from the UX analysis.

| Step | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Visit landing page and reach dashboard | ✅ pass | Browser opens https://invoify.vercel.app/en; Dashboard loads, “Actions” heading visible.; Invoify logo confirmed in header. |
| Enter sender (“Bill From”) name | ✅ pass | Locate Bill From section.; Click Name field and type “zeeshan”.; Live Preview eventually shows name after a short retry. |
| Enter sender (“Bill From”) address | ✅ pass | Focus Address field, type “street 123”.; Live Preview eventually shows address after one retry (≈39 s total for this step). |
| Verify default tab state – From & To | ❌ fail | Test tries to assert black-background selected state.; Locator matching ‘1  .  From & To’ not found → timeout (5 s).; Screenshot not captured; flow stops here. |
| Add custom input to Bill From | ❌ fail | Click “Add Custom Input”.; Type custom field name ‘Gender’ (took 318 s!).; Type value ‘Male’.; Assertion that preview shows ‘Male’ times out – element not found.; Flow stops, screenshot missing. |
| Delete custom input field | ✅ pass | Add a custom field again then click delete icon.; Confirm field removed from DOM. |

### Qualitative Improvement Opportunities

Identified areas for UX improvement with rationale and actionable next steps.

| Area | Why It Matters | Next Actions |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| **Live Preview latency after form edits** | Users expect real-time feedback; delays create uncertainty (“Did my input register?”). | • Investigate state-update timing; remove unnecessary debounces.<br>• Show skeleton/‘updating…’ micro-animation while preview renders.<br>• Add instant inline confirmation (e.g., checkmark) next to edited field. |
| **Default tab visual indicator (“From & To”)** | Clear orientation in a multi-step editor is critical; missing or subtle selection styles cause confusion and way-finding errors. | • Ensure selected tab has high-contrast background that meets WCAG AA.<br>• Use semantic <button role="tab"> with aria-selected="true" so both automation & screen-readers recognise state.<br>• Simplify visible label to “1. From & To” (remove double spaces and dot) to avoid string-matching issues. |
| **Custom field value not propagating to preview** | Bespoke invoice fields are a power feature; if they don’t render, users lose trust and may abandon the tool. | • Fix data binding for dynamic fields—confirm both key and value push to preview component.<br>• Add unit test covering add-edit-delete lifecycle.<br>• Display inline error if a custom field cannot be rendered. |
| **Performance spikes (318 s to type into field)** | Huge delays suggest blocking calls or memory leaks; even if automated test exaggerated, any multi-second lag is unacceptable for users. | • Profile JavaScript when adding custom inputs; look for expensive re-renders.<br>• Lazy-render only the changed part of preview rather than full refresh.<br>• Monitor and cap image/font network requests on initial load. |
| **Missing fallback screenshots on failure** | When things break, visual context speeds up debugging and reduces time-to-fix. | • Enable always-capture-on-fail in test runner.<br>• Embed error message overlay in screenshot for quick triage. |

### Priority Action Items

Ranked list of immediate actions to improve the user experience, ordered by impact and feasibility.

1. **Fix data binding so custom fields instantly appear in Live Preview.**
2. **Add clear, high-contrast selected state for default “From & To” tab (ARIA-compliant).**
3. **Optimize preview update pipeline to display edits within <500 ms; show loading indicator during render.**
4. **Enable automatic screenshot capture on any failed test step for faster QA turnaround.**
5. **Run performance profiling on custom-input workflow to eliminate multi-minute freezes.**
