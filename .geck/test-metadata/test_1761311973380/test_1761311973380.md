## UX Analysis

*UX analysis data is also available as raw JSON in `ux-analysis.json` in this directory.*

### Emotional Journey

This analysis describes the user's emotional experience throughout the test execution, highlighting moments of confidence, frustration, and satisfaction.

> Starts with confidence (logo & basic inputs work). Mild satisfaction as live preview mirrors simple fields. First frustration appears when tab styling isn‚Äôt highlighted. Confidence dips sharply when custom-field and logo flows break‚Äîuser questions reliability. Recovered slightly by smooth delete and navigation. Frustration deepens with date, template, and full PDF failures; sense that advanced features are flaky. Ending on a positive note: reset and validation behave correctly, but overall trust remains low.

### Step-by-Step Narrative

Detailed breakdown of each test step with status and key observations from the UX analysis.

| Step | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Landing on dashboard | ‚úÖ pass | Site loads and user is welcomed by dashboard with Invoify logo. |
| Editing ‚ÄúBill From‚Äù basics | ‚úÖ pass | User successfully types sender name and address; live-preview updates correctly. |
| Default tab styling | ‚ùå fail | Expected ‚ÄúFrom & To‚Äù tab to look selected‚Äîsystem never renders the black background. First sign of UI/state mismatch. |
| Adding a custom field | ‚ùå fail | User adds custom field (Gender=Male). Field appears in form but preview never reflects value ‚Äì trust breaks. |
| Deleting a custom field | ‚úÖ pass | Delete control instantly removes field; behaviour feels solid. |
| Navigating to Invoice Details | ‚úÖ pass | ‚ÄòNext‚Äô button moves focus to second tab; heading visible. Navigation feels predictable. |
| Uploading logo | ‚ùå fail | Tab button can‚Äôt be clicked (locator not found) in first attempt; second attempt hits 429 quota error. User blocked from adding logo. |
| Removing uploaded logo | ‚ùå fail | Upload itself fails, so removal sequence never happens. |
| Setting Issue Date | ‚ùå fail | Date picker fills field, but live preview never shows chosen date ‚Äì data binding gap. |
| Choosing Template 2 | ‚ùå fail | Click executes but template does not appear selected nor preview updated ‚Äì user uncertain which template is active. |
| Full invoice creation & PDF | ‚ùå fail | Massive multi-step flow aborts early (script overrun). User cannot reach PDF generation end-to-end. |
| Resetting form via ‚ÄòNew Invoice‚Äô | ‚úÖ pass | After filling many fields, ‚ÄòNew Invoice‚Äô empties them all ‚Äì clear state reset works. |
| Pressing Generate PDF with empty form | ‚úÖ pass | Validation errors surface inline, preventing empty submission ‚Äì good guidance. |

### Qualitative Improvement Opportunities

Identified areas for UX improvement with rationale and actionable next steps.

| Area | Why It Matters | Next Actions |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| **Tab state indication & navigation** | Users rely on clear visual cues to know where they are in a multi-step wizard; missing ‚Äòactive‚Äô styles cause disorientation. | ‚Ä¢ Verify CSS classes applied on initial load; add regression test.<br>‚Ä¢ Ensure focus/aria-selected attributes update for accessibility.<br>‚Ä¢ Add subtle animation when tab becomes active. |
| **Live Preview data binding** | Preview is the product‚Äôs main value prop. When fields (custom input, issue date, template) don‚Äôt reflect immediately, users think the app is broken. | ‚Ä¢ Audit state management: confirm every form slice dispatches to preview component.<br>‚Ä¢ Add unit tests for each field ‚Üí preview expectation.<br>‚Ä¢ Throttle debounce (<=300 ms) so updates feel realtime. |
| **Custom fields workflow** | Business users often need bespoke fields; seeing them ignored in preview undermines flexibility promise. | ‚Ä¢ After adding custom input, inject into preview JSON/render layer.<br>‚Ä¢ Show toast confirmation: ‚ÄúCustom field added to invoice‚Äù. |
| **Logo upload & removal** | Branding is critical; failing upload halts progress and causes churn. | ‚Ä¢ QA file-input selector (id mismatch?).<br>‚Ä¢ Handle 4xx errors gracefully with user-friendly copy.<br>‚Ä¢ Allow drag-and-drop fallback. |
| **Template selection feedback** | Without clear selection state (checkmark) and preview update, users cannot compare designs. | ‚Ä¢ Ensure selected button gains ‚Äòselected‚Äô class & aria-pressed.<br>‚Ä¢ Trigger preview re-render on template id change.<br>‚Ä¢ Display tiny loader while assets switch to avoid flicker. |
| **Performance / timeout thresholds** | Several steps time-out at 5 s; real users may experience similar stalls. | ‚Ä¢ Profile API & render times; lazy-load heavy components.<br>‚Ä¢ Increase Playwright timeouts only after performance fixes. |
| **End-to-end PDF generation** | Core business outcome; inability to complete destroys conversion. | ‚Ä¢ Create shorter, saveable drafts so users don‚Äôt lose progress.<br>‚Ä¢ Add progress indicator while PDF is building.<br>‚Ä¢ Integrate server-side logging to capture build errors. |

### Priority Action Items

Ranked list of immediate actions to improve the user experience, ordered by impact and feasibility.

1. **Fix live-preview bindings for custom fields, issue date, and template‚Äîvisible payoff and low code surface.**
2. **Restore and test tab ‚Äòactive‚Äô styling so users always know current step.**
3. **Repair logo upload flow (input selector & error handling) to unblock branding.**
4. **Implement immediate visual confirmation on template selection (checkmark + preview switch).**
5. **Optimize initial load/performance to prevent 5-second automation & user timeouts.**
