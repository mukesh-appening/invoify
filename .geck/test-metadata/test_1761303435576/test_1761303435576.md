## UX Analysis

*UX analysis data is also available as raw JSON in `ux-analysis.json` in this directory.*

### Emotional Journey

This analysis describes the user's emotional experience throughout the test execution, highlighting moments of confidence, frustration, and satisfaction.

> Initial confidence (logo, simple inputs) ‚Üí mild friction (preview lags) ‚Üí confusion (missing selected-tab style) ‚Üí frustration (custom field not reflected) ‚Üí relief (deletion works, Next navigation works) ‚Üí renewed frustration (can‚Äôt access Invoice Details via tab click, logo upload fails).

### Step-by-Step Narrative

Detailed breakdown of each test step with status and key observations from the UX analysis.

| Step | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Open dashboard & verify header logo | ‚úÖ pass | User lands on /en dashboard, sees ‚ÄòActions‚Äô heading and Invoify logo. |
| Enter sender name | ‚úÖ pass | Types ‚Äúzeeshan‚Äù in Bill-From ‚Üí Name.; Live-preview updates after a short delay (retry needed). |
| Enter sender address | ‚úÖ pass | Types ‚Äústreet 123‚Äù in Bill-From ‚Üí Address.; Live-preview updates but only after ~40 s polling. |
| Check default tab styling | ‚ùå fail | Expected ‚Äò1. From & To‚Äô tab to appear selected (black background).; Locator not found ‚Üí either label differs or element missing selected style. |
| Add custom field | ‚ùå fail | Adds custom field (‚ÄúGender: Male‚Äù).; Field appears in form, but NOT in Live-preview ‚Üí expectation times out. |
| Delete custom field | ‚úÖ pass | Creates then deletes a custom field; DOM element disappears as expected. |
| Use Next button to go to Invoice Details | ‚úÖ pass | Clicking ‚ÄòNext‚Äô switches to tab 2; ‚ÄòInvoice Details:‚Äô heading visible. |
| Click tab to open Invoice Details & upload logo | ‚ùå fail | Direct click on ‚Äú2. Invoice Details‚Äù tab not possible (locator timeout).; Sub-steps to upload and verify logo never run. |
| Upload & remove logo (partial) | ‚ùå fail | ‚ÄòNext‚Äô navigation works, upload attempt fails (file path & UI).; Sub-steps to verify / remove logo never executed. |

### Qualitative Improvement Opportunities

Identified areas for UX improvement with rationale and actionable next steps.

| Area | Why It Matters | Next Actions |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| **Tab labeling & selection styling** | Users rely on clear visual cues and predictable labels to know where they are. Missing or malformed labels break accessibility and cause locator failures. | ‚Ä¢ Remove extra spaces/emoji/bullet chars from tab text.<br>‚Ä¢ Set explicit aria-labels and role=‚Äútab‚Äù.<br>‚Ä¢ Ensure selected tab has consistent visible style (bg-color) across load states. |
| **Live-preview responsiveness** | Slow or inconsistent preview undermines trust; users may think input was lost. | ‚Ä¢ Debounce front-end updates to ‚â§500 ms.<br>‚Ä¢ Show a tiny spinner or ‚Äòupdating‚Ä¶‚Äô text until preview refreshes.<br>‚Ä¢ Add automated tests that wait on a dedicated ‚Äòdata-status=updated‚Äô attribute instead of arbitrary timeouts. |
| **Custom input ‚Üí preview mapping** | Custom fields are core to flexible invoices; if a user can‚Äôt see them reflected, feature feels broken. | ‚Ä¢ Ensure new custom fields are appended to preview JSON & rendered.<br>‚Ä¢ Add unit test for mapping logic, not only E2E.<br>‚Ä¢ Surface an inline error if a field name duplicates existing keys. |
| **Invoice Details tab discoverability** | Some users click the numbered tabs, others the Next button. Both paths must work. | ‚Ä¢ Give each tab a stable, sanitized id or data-testid.<br>‚Ä¢ Shrink click-target whitespace so label text is literal ‚Äò2. Invoice Details‚Äô. |
| **File upload UX** | Logo is high-visibility. Failed uploads or unclear states cause frustration. | ‚Ä¢ Accept drag-and-drop and clipboard paste.<br>‚Ä¢ Show thumbnail + filename on success, error toast on fail.<br>‚Ä¢ Store a temp logo in localStorage so refreshes keep state. |
| **Automation-friendly hooks** | Stable selectors reduce flaky tests and benefit screen readers. | ‚Ä¢ Add data-testid attributes to key elements (tabs, buttons, preview slots).<br>‚Ä¢ Document them for QA and assistive-tech parity. |

### Priority Action Items

Ranked list of immediate actions to improve the user experience, ordered by impact and feasibility.

1. **Standardize tab text/aria and selected styling so ‚ÄòFrom & To‚Äô is reliably detected and visually highlighted.**
2. **Fix custom-field mapping so values instantly appear in Live preview.**
3. **Add loading indicator & throttle logic so preview updates feel instantaneous and tests don‚Äôt need long retries.**
4. **Provide stable data-testid hooks on tabs, inputs, and preview sections to cut automated test flakiness.**
5. **Improve logo upload component: clear empty-state, drag-and-drop support, visible thumbnail on success.**
