## UX Analysis

*UX analysis data is also available as raw JSON in `ux-analysis.json` in this directory.*

### Emotional Journey

This analysis describes the user's emotional experience throughout the test execution, highlighting moments of confidence, frustration, and satisfaction.

> Starts with confidence as basic fields work. Mild annoyance when preview lags. Frustration rises when visual cues (active tab styling) and data-binding (custom field, date) fail. High friction and uncertainty during logo upload and template switch, ending journey on a negative note.

### Step-by-Step Narrative

Detailed breakdown of each test step with status and key observations from the UX analysis.

| Step | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Land on Invoify dashboard | ✅ pass | Browser opens https://invoify.vercel.app/en; Dashboard and Invoify logo render successfully |
| Fill in “Bill From” – Name | ✅ pass | User types “zeeshan”; Name instantly appears in Live Preview |
| Fill in “Bill From” – Address | ✅ pass | User enters “street 123”; Address shows in Live Preview after a slight delay (retry needed) |
| Attempt to verify default ‘From & To’ tab styling | ❌ fail | Test could not locate button with expected label/role; Background-color class for selected tab not found |
| Add custom field (Gender → Male) | ❌ fail | Field can be added and values typed; Live Preview never shows new field; binding missing |
| Delete custom field | ✅ pass | User adds then removes a custom field; Field disappears as expected |
| Navigate to ‘Invoice Details’ via Next button | ✅ pass | Next button switches active tab; Invoice Details heading visible |
| Direct click on ‘2. Invoice Details’ tab | ❌ fail | Element with label ‘2 . Invoice Details’ not clickable/found without scrolling |
| Upload (and later remove) invoice logo | ❌ fail | File-upload control interaction flaky; Remove-logo flow never executed due to earlier failure |
| Set Issue Date (Oct 1 2025) | ❌ fail | Date picker updates form field; Live Preview does NOT reflect new date |
| Switch to Template 2 and check preview | ❌ fail | Template buttons visible; Selecting Template 2 does not show selected state or update preview |

### Qualitative Improvement Opportunities

Identified areas for UX improvement with rationale and actionable next steps.

| Area | Why It Matters | Next Actions |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| **Tab navigation & visibility** | Users need clear indication of where they are and intuitive ways to move between steps. Missing active-state styling and hidden buttons create disorientation. | • Normalize tab text (remove extra spaces) and add aria-labels for reliable targeting<br>• Ensure selected tab always carries a stable CSS class (e.g., .is-active)<br>• Keep step tabs in viewport (sticky or scroll-into-view on load) |
| **Live Preview data-binding** | Instant visual feedback is the product’s core value proposition; delays or missing fields break trust. | • Debounce input but guarantee update within 200 ms<br>• Add loading spinner or subtle ‘saving…’ text while state propagates<br>• Write unit tests for each field → preview mapping (custom fields, dates, invoice number, etc.) |
| **Custom fields experience** | Personalisation is powerful—if the preview ignores it, users assume the feature is broken. | • Map dynamic fields to preview with generic renderer instead of hard-coded list<br>• Show placeholder in preview the moment a custom field is added, even if value empty<br>• Confirm deletion also removes preview artefact |
| **File upload & logo management** | Logos are brand identity; failed uploads or missing feedback erode professionalism. | • Use native <input type=file> visible element with clear drag-and-drop zone<br>• Display upload progress and success/error toast<br>• Expose ‘Remove logo’ only after successful upload and ensure preview refreshes |
| **Template selection feedback** | Visual templates drive purchase intent. Lack of confirmation or preview update leaves users uncertain. | • Add ‘selected’ badge/outline immediately upon click<br>• Instantly rerender preview; show skeleton until render complete<br>• Persist last chosen template in localStorage to reinforce selection on reload |
| **Accessibility & testability** | Stable roles/labels help both assistive tech and automated QA, reducing regressions. | • Use semantic HTML and aria-labels for all interactive elements<br>• Avoid injecting extra spaces/hidden characters in button text<br>• Provide consistent IDs for critical controls (tabs, upload, select buttons) |

### Priority Action Items

Ranked list of immediate actions to improve the user experience, ordered by impact and feasibility.

1. **Add a stable ‘selected’ CSS class and aria-label to each step tab; verify default tab gets class on load.**
2. **Ensure form → Live Preview binding for custom fields and date values fires on input/change, not on debounce timeout.**
3. **Standardise button text (remove whitespace anomalies like ‘2  .  Invoice Details’) so elements are findable and screen-reader friendly.**
4. **Show immediate visual confirmation when a template is selected (checkmark/outline) and trigger preview re-render.**
5. **Expose a native, always-visible file-input area with progress indicator to make logo uploads deterministic and testable.**
