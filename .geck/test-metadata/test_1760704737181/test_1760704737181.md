## UX Analysis

*UX analysis data is also available as raw JSON in `ux-analysis.json` in this directory.*

### Emotional Journey

This analysis describes the user's emotional experience throughout the test execution, highlighting moments of confidence, frustration, and satisfaction.

> A real user would start confident when the homepage appears, but quickly become confused when expected headers or sections never render. Repeated attempts to interact (clicking template buttons, signature areas, wizard steps) fail silently, leading to frustration and doubt about site stability. Visual inconsistencies (spacing, mis-aligned fields) add a feeling of sloppiness, eroding trust. By the time they try advanced tasks (logo, tax, signatures) they would likely abandon the process.

### Step-by-Step Narrative

Detailed breakdown of each test step with status and key observations from the UX analysis.

| Step | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Launch application | ‚úÖ pass | Every scenario begins by opening https://invoify.vercel.app and the landing page loads. |
| Attempt to reach core wizard steps (Bill From / Bill To / Line Items / Tax) | ‚ùå fail | ‚ÄòBill From‚Äô header never appears (Test: Bill From section).; ‚ÄòBill To‚Äô header never appears (Test: Bill To section).; ‚ÄòLine Items‚Äô step 3 button not found (Financial calculations ‚Äì line items).; ‚ÄòTax Calculation‚Äô panel not found (Financial calculations ‚Äì tax). |
| Try to interact with template-related features | ‚ùå fail | Main interface header (‚ÄòBETA English Toggle theme‚Äô) not visible; template list cannot be selected.; Invoice templates section for logo upload cannot be found.; Template buttons show style inconsistencies. |
| Live-preview behaviour | ‚ùå mixed | Preview panel itself loads (pass) but fails to refresh when form data changes (Real-time updates ‚Äì step 6 fail).; Wizard‚Äìpreview sync test cannot click ‚Äò1 . From & To‚Äô button (step fails). |
| Signature workflows | ‚ùå fail | Canvas for drawing signature not visible.; Typed-signature area not found.; Upload area for signature image missing. |
| Basic visual QA issues surfaced by UI review bot | ‚ùå fail | Frequent reports of mis-aligned labels/inputs, inconsistent padding & margins, non-uniform buttons, placeholder copy ‚Äòlooks off‚Äô. |

### Qualitative Improvement Opportunities

Identified areas for UX improvement with rationale and actionable next steps.

| Area | Why It Matters | Next Actions |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| **Critical elements not rendered / missing DOM nodes** | When key wizard sections (Bill From, Bill To, Line Items, Tax, Signature canvases) fail to appear, users are blocked and assume the product is broken. | ‚Ä¢ Audit component mounting logic ‚Äì verify conditional rendering and route/state dependencies.<br>‚Ä¢ Add end-to-end smoke test that asserts presence of each step header after load.<br>‚Ä¢ Display friendly error state if component fails instead of nothing. |
| **Live preview does not update reliably** | Real-time feedback is a headline feature; if changes aren‚Äôt mirrored promptly, users lose trust and may think data hasn‚Äôt saved. | ‚Ä¢ Debounce / throttle input handlers but ensure state propagation to preview.<br>‚Ä¢ Add visual ‚Äòsyncing‚Äô indicator or last-updated timestamp.<br>‚Ä¢ Unit-test preview store with field change events. |
| **Inconsistent spacing, alignment, and button styling** | Visual noise lowers perceived quality and accessibility, especially in a form-heavy tool. | ‚Ä¢ Establish design tokens for spacing & typography and apply globally.<br>‚Ä¢ Add CSS linting & visual regression tests.<br>‚Ä¢ Run quick style pass on form label/field alignment. |
| **Unclear or placeholder copy** | Placeholders like ‚ÄòBETA English‚Äô or non-informative examples leave users unsure how to proceed and look unpolished. | ‚Ä¢ Replace placeholders with instructive examples (e.g., ‚ÄòAcme Corp, 123 Main St‚Äô).<br>‚Ä¢ Create content style-guide for headings & placeholders.<br>‚Ä¢ Implement i18n fallback so missing strings surface clearly during QA. |
| **Missing signature & logo upload affordances** | Signatures and branding are required for a usable invoice; if users cannot locate these, they cannot complete their task. | ‚Ä¢ Ensure signature canvas/upload widgets are visible behind feature flags or in correct wizard step.<br>‚Ä¢ Add prominent ‚ÄòAdd signature/logo‚Äô buttons with iconography.<br>‚Ä¢ Provide sample signature to illustrate expected outcome. |
| **Template change interaction feedback** | Switching templates is a high-impact action; no visual confirmation leaves users guessing. | ‚Ä¢ Display loading skeleton or highlight selected template.<br>‚Ä¢ Ensure preview re-renders after template ID change and write integration test.<br>‚Ä¢ Standardise button sizes & card selection states. |

### Priority Action Items

Ranked list of immediate actions to improve the user experience, ordered by impact and feasibility.

1. **Guarantee initial wizard sections (Bill From & Bill To) mount on first load ‚Äì blocking defect causing multiple test failures.**
2. **Fix live-preview state binding so any field change instantly updates preview; add smoke test.**
3. **Apply global CSS spacing & alignment rules to remove most ‚Äòlooks off‚Äô visual issues (quick design token pass).**
4. **Expose signature canvas/upload & typed signature inputs behind a clear ‚ÄòAdd Signature‚Äô CTA.**
5. **Swap placeholder / beta copy for real instructional text, especially in form placeholders.**
