## UX Analysis

*UX analysis data is also available as raw JSON in `ux-analysis.json` in this directory.*

### Emotional Journey

This analysis describes the user's emotional experience throughout the test execution, highlighting moments of confidence, frustration, and satisfaction.

> The shopper starts confident‚Äîsite loads quickly‚Äîbut immediately encounters missing sections (Bill From / Bill To). Frustration grows as basic wizard elements are invisible. A brief moment of reassurance occurs when the user sees data mirrored in the live preview, but hopes are dashed when edits stop updating. Repeated style inconsistencies (spacing, button styles) add subtle irritation. Overall feeling: mounting distrust and abandonment risk.

### Step-by-Step Narrative

Detailed breakdown of each test step with status and key observations from the UX analysis.

| Step | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Launch site | ‚úÖ pass | Every scenario begins by successfully opening https://invoify.vercel.app. |
| Invoice Wizard ‚Äí Bill From (Step 1) | ‚ùå fail | Expected ‚ÄúBill From:‚Äù header never appears; test times out before any field can be filled. |
| Invoice Wizard ‚Äí Bill To (Step 1) | ‚ùå fail | Similar timeout looking for ‚ÄúBill To:‚Äù header. Wizard either fails to render the section or uses text/markup the locator cannot find. |
| Landing Page / Global Header | ‚ùå fail | Header text ‚ÄúBETA English Toggle theme‚Äù not found, suggesting content shift or slow load. |
| Template Selection | ‚ùå fail | Template thumbnails never become interactable; live preview can‚Äôt be validated. |
| Logo Upload | ‚ùå fail | Logo-upload control is not visible inside template area; test stops at step 2. |
| Live Preview ‚Äì Initial Population | ‚úÖ pass | Form fields can be filled and initial preview shows entered data. |
| Live Preview ‚Äì Real-time update | ‚ùå fail | Editing existing data does not always propagate to preview (e.g., ZIP field repeatedly fails). |
| Wizard Step Synchronisation | ‚ùå fail | Button ‚Äú1 . From & To‚Äù cannot be clicked (locator timeout). Preview synchronisation with steps left untested. |
| Signature Canvas | ‚ùå fail | <canvas> element never becomes visible; drawing cannot begin. |

### Qualitative Improvement Opportunities

Identified areas for UX improvement with rationale and actionable next steps.

| Area | Why It Matters | Next Actions |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| **Critical elements not rendering / mis-identified (Bill From, Bill To, Signature canvas, Logo upload)** | When primary tasks cannot even start, users churn instantly; automated tests also break, hiding further issues. | ‚Ä¢ Audit component mounting logic‚Äîverify Step 1 actually injects both sections into the DOM on first paint.<br>‚Ä¢ Add loading skeleton or progress indicator so users know something is coming.<br>‚Ä¢ Provide stable data-testids or ARIA labels so both users (assistive tech) and tests can reliably locate elements. |
| **Selector / Copy mismatches (extra spaces, colons, regex-unfriendly labels)** | Tiny text changes break automation and confuse users who rely on clear headings. | ‚Ä¢ Standardise headings (‚ÄúBill From‚Äù, ‚ÄúBill To‚Äù) and remove trailing special characters from visible copy.<br>‚Ä¢ Introduce dedicated, version-safe attributes (e.g., data-testid="bill-from-header"). |
| **Inconsistent spacing, padding, and button styling** | Visual noise reduces perceived quality and can impair readability/accessibility. | ‚Ä¢ Create shared design tokens for spacing and button variants.<br>‚Ä¢ Run a quick CSS pass to equalise margins between form groups and unify button dimensions. |
| **Live preview does not update reliably after edits** | Real-time feedback is the product‚Äôs wow factor; if it lags, the feature feels broken. | ‚Ä¢ Debounce form-to-preview binding less aggressively or add explicit change listeners for all fields (ZIP failed repeatedly).<br>‚Ä¢ Write unit tests to assert that each field emits state updates. |
| **Template system missing controls (template thumbnails, logo upload)** | Customisation is a core value prop; hidden controls translate to lost conversions. | ‚Ä¢ Ensure template selector and logo uploader are rendered inside viewport; add fallback text if feature flags disable them.<br>‚Ä¢ Surface uploader with a visible button and placeholder image that invites interaction. |
| **Accessibility / Semantic markup** | Proper semantics improve both UX and test stability. | ‚Ä¢ Use <h2>/<h3> for section titles instead of lone <h4> strings; add aria-labels for canvases.<br>‚Ä¢ Include focus states and keyboard navigation for wizard steps. |

### Priority Action Items

Ranked list of immediate actions to improve the user experience, ordered by impact and feasibility.

1. **Guarantee Step 1 renders both ‚ÄúBill From‚Äù and ‚ÄúBill To‚Äù sections with stable data-testids‚Äîusers can actually start an invoice.**
2. **Add reliable two-way binding for all form fields to live preview (fix ZIP and other lagging fields).**
3. **Standardise heading copy and introduce data-testid attributes to decouple UI text from test selectors.**
4. **Quick CSS sweep to normalise spacing and button styles‚Äîfast visual uplift with minimal code.**
5. **Expose logo-upload control and signature canvas by default; fall back to informative placeholders if feature is not ready.**
