## UX Analysis

*UX analysis data is also available as raw JSON in `ux-analysis.json` in this directory.*

### Emotional Journey

This analysis describes the user's emotional experience throughout the test execution, highlighting moments of confidence, frustration, and satisfaction.

> A real user starts with optimism (site loads) but immediately hits confusion when the expected invoice wizard is not apparent. After a few seconds of uncertainty, frustration grows and confidence drops, likely causing the user to abandon or seek help.

### Step-by-Step Narrative

Detailed breakdown of each test step with status and key observations from the UX analysis.

| Step | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Launch site | ‚úÖ pass | Browser opened https://invoify.vercel.app successfully.; Landing screen rendered without visible errors. |
| Expect to see ‚ÄúBill From‚Äù section (Step 1 of wizard) | ‚ùå fail | System waited 5 s for an <h4> element containing text ‚ÄúBill From  :‚Äù.; Element never appeared ‚Üí hard failure; wizard either did not load or heading text/layout differs from expectation. |
| Remaining form-entry and validation steps | ‚ùå skipped | Because the core UI element was not found, the test aborted and none of the data-entry, validation, persistence, or screenshot checks could run. |

### Qualitative Improvement Opportunities

Identified areas for UX improvement with rationale and actionable next steps.

| Area | Why It Matters | Next Actions |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| **Entry-point discoverability of the invoice wizard** | If users do not instantly see where to begin creating an invoice, they feel lost and may leave. | ‚Ä¢ On first load, auto-open Step 1 of the wizard or show a prominent ‚ÄúCreate invoice‚Äù CTA above the fold.<br>‚Ä¢ Add micro-copy or onboarding tooltip guiding first-time visitors. |
| **Consistent, scannable headings (e.g., ‚ÄúBill From‚Äù)** | Unexpected heading text, extra spaces, or styling changes break both automated tests and human pattern-recognition, reducing trust. | ‚Ä¢ Standardize wizard section titles and keep them semantically marked as <h*>, not buried in divs.<br>‚Ä¢ Add explicit data-testids so copy tweaks don‚Äôt break functionality visibility. |
| **Perceived performance / loading feedback** | 5 s of blank or ambiguous UI feels broken; users don‚Äôt know whether to wait or refresh. | ‚Ä¢ Display a skeleton loader or progress indicator while wizard assets initialize.<br>‚Ä¢ Lazy-load non-critical resources so Step 1 is interactive sooner. |
| **State persistence between steps (not reached in test)** | Users expect previously entered data to remain when they navigate back; losing it creates frustration. | ‚Ä¢ Ensure form values are cached locally (e.g., in context or localStorage) and repopulated on return.<br>‚Ä¢ Surface autosave feedback (‚ÄúAll changes saved‚Äù). |
| **Validation messaging clarity (not reached)** | Clear, immediate error messages reduce form-completion anxiety. | ‚Ä¢ Show inline validation as soon as a field loses focus, not only on submit.<br>‚Ä¢ Use plain-language guidance (‚ÄúPlease enter your company name‚Äù). |

### Priority Action Items

Ranked list of immediate actions to improve the user experience, ordered by impact and feasibility.

1. **Auto-launch or clearly expose the ‚ÄúCreate Invoice‚Äù wizard on page load to eliminate the initial dead-end.**
2. **Add consistent semantic headings and stable data-testids for wizard sections (e.g., id="bill-from-heading").**
3. **Introduce a lightweight skeleton loader or spinner for the wizard so users know it is loading.**
4. **Implement inline, plain-language validation messages for required fields.**
