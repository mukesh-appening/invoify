## UX Analysis

*UX analysis data is also available as raw JSON in `ux-analysis.json` in this directory.*

### Emotional Journey

This analysis describes the user's emotional experience throughout the test execution, highlighting moments of confidence, frustration, and satisfaction.

> Hopeful on first load → Confused when the expected first form (Bill From / Bill To) never appears → Growing frustration as multiple key UI elements (header, template selector, logo upload) cannot be located → Brief relief when live preview shows initial data → Trust shaken when edits do not propagate → Overall sense of unreliability and polish issues by the end of the session.

### Step-by-Step Narrative

Detailed breakdown of each test step with status and key observations from the UX analysis.

| Step | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Landing on Invoify | ✅ pass | Every scenario starts by opening https://invoify.vercel.app and loading succeeds. |
| Expecting Step-1 (Bill From / Bill To) | ❌ fail | Both dedicated tests time-out looking for headings ‘Bill From :’ and ‘Bill To :’.; User never sees the first form screen and therefore cannot proceed with invoice creation. |
| Template system – page chrome | ❌ fail | Landing-page header “BETA English Toggle theme” is not found, blocking all later template actions (select Template 1, Template 2, logo upload). |
| Logo upload journey | ❌ fail | User cannot locate logo-upload entry point; test aborts immediately after opening the app. |
| Live preview – basic entry | ❌ mixed | User is able to fill all ‘Bill From’ and ‘Bill To’ fields and sees data appear in preview (passes).; When editing data afterward, at least one field (Zip) fails to update in preview – user loses trust (hard fail). |
| Wizard / preview synchronization | ❌ fail | Wizard step button ‘1 . From & To’ is not clickable (timeout); user stuck on step navigation. |
| Visual review issues captured automatically | ❌ mixed | Frequent ‘looks off’ flags: inconsistent button styles, mis-aligned labels, uneven padding, placeholder copy not informative, missing logo option visibility. |

### Qualitative Improvement Opportunities

Identified areas for UX improvement with rationale and actionable next steps.

| Area | Why It Matters | Next Actions |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| **Initial wizard screen visibility (Bill From / Bill To)** | Users abandon quickly if they can’t find the first required fields; core task blocked. | • Ensure Step 1 renders immediately on page load.<br>• Add loading skeleton or progress indicator until the wizard mounts.<br>• Audit heading text—remove trailing spaces/colons that break locators and may impair accessibility. |
| **Header / global navigation load** | Missing header prevents access to language switch, theme toggle, and signals that page failed partially. | • Defer non-critical scripts so core UI paints first.<br>• Use robust CSS that doesn’t collapse header in low-width viewports.<br>• Log front-end errors and surface fallback UI if header fails to mount. |
| **Template & logo controls discoverability** | Customization is a selling point; users must immediately see where to change template or upload logo. | • Place template selector and logo upload in consistently sized, labeled card near preview.<br>• Add ‘Upload logo’ button with universal icon and help tooltip.<br>• Persist selections in local storage to reinforce success. |
| **Live preview reliability** | Real-time feedback builds trust; any lag or miss undermines perceived quality. | • Debounce form-to-preview binding less aggressively or diff-test every field.<br>• Write unit tests for each field → preview mapping (e.g., Zip).<br>• Show small spinner in preview while data is syncing. |
| **Layout & visual consistency** | Uneven spacing and misaligned labels make product feel unfinished and hamper readability. | • Adopt design tokens for spacing (8-pt grid).<br>• Run CSS linter / visual regression tests on every commit.<br>• Standardize button component variants (primary, secondary) and enforce in Storybook. |
| **Copy & placeholder text** | Generic placeholders (‘Placeholder text is not informative’) do not instruct users, hurting form completion rates. | • Replace placeholders with examples (e.g., ‘Acme Corp.’, ‘123 Main St.’).<br>• Keep placeholder text lighter color but accessible contrast. |

### Priority Action Items

Ranked list of immediate actions to improve the user experience, ordered by impact and feasibility.

1. **Guarantee Step 1 (‘Bill From’ & ‘Bill To’ sections) is visible instantly on load; add fallback message if data fails to render.**
2. **Fix two-way binding bugs so every edited field updates live preview in <200 ms.**
3. **Standardize spacing, label alignment, and button styles via a single design-system stylesheet.**
4. **Add explicit ‘Template’ selector and ‘Upload logo’ button next to live preview to improve discoverability.**
5. **Replace generic placeholder copy with concrete, helpful examples to speed form completion.**
