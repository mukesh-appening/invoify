## UX Analysis

*UX analysis data is also available as raw JSON in `ux-analysis.json` in this directory.*

### Emotional Journey

This analysis describes the user's emotional experience throughout the test execution, highlighting moments of confidence, frustration, and satisfaction.

> Confidence at page load → mild concern at visual inconsistencies → sharp frustration when core sections (Bill From, Bill To, Line Items, Signature, etc.) never appear → repeated failure to proceed amplifies distrust in the product’s reliability → abandonment.

### Step-by-Step Narrative

Detailed breakdown of each test step with status and key observations from the UX analysis.

| Step | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Landing on Invoify home page | ✅ pass | Every test begins by successfully loading https://invoify.vercel.app in the browser.; No hard technical errors; page renders, but multiple visual ‘looks-off’ issues are captured (mis-aligned labels, inconsistent padding, placeholder text). |
| Attempt to open Invoice Wizard – Step 1: “Bill From” / “Bill To” | ❌ fail | Tests that look for headings “Bill From :” or “Bill To :” time-out (element not found).; Result: Users cannot progress beyond the first step of invoice creation. |
| Template selection & live preview load | ❌ fail | Locators for header text (“BETA English Toggle theme”) and template radio buttons are not found.; Live preview panel does appear in some flows, but real-time updates fail once data is edited. |
| Logo upload in templates | ❌ fail | The UI element for uploading a logo is missing/hidden; tests abort at this point. |
| Wizard step navigation synchronisation | ❌ fail | Button “1 . From & To” is not clickable (timeout).; Live preview does not sync when users move between wizard steps. |
| Signature – draw, type, upload | ❌ fail | Canvas for drawing signature not visible.; Typed-signature section & upload area not found.; Users would be blocked from adding a signature. |
| Financial calculations – line items, tax, discount, shipping | ❌ fail | Sections “3 . Line Items”, “Tax Calculation”, calculation fields (Subtotal, Total) not visible within timeout.; Auto-calculation tests cannot run. |
| PDF generation & Email distribution | ❌ fail | Primary invoice sections load but key form areas (e.g., “Bill From”) still missing, preventing PDF generation.; Dashboard header expected text (“Dashboard”) not present, halting email-send flow. |
| Multi-format export (JSON/CSV/XML) | ❌ fail | Invoice date renders as “Invalid Date”, causing dashboard validation to fail early.; Export menu itself never reached. |

### Qualitative Improvement Opportunities

Identified areas for UX improvement with rationale and actionable next steps.

| Area | Why It Matters | Next Actions |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| **Missing / renamed DOM elements (e.g., “Bill From :”, “Bill To :”)** | Automated and manual users rely on clear, predictable headings to orient themselves. If these are absent or renamed, users feel lost and flows break. | • Audit current UI copy vs. design spec; reinstate or update headings.<br>• Add data-test-id attributes to critical sections to keep tests & users resilient to copy tweaks.<br>• Run moderated usability session to verify discoverability of Step 1 sections. |
| **Visual consistency – alignment, spacing, button styling** | Uneven UI erodes professionalism and forces users to spend extra cognitive effort locating fields. | • Introduce a spacing & typography scale in CSS/Design System.<br>• Run linting/CI checks for style regressions.<br>• Standardise button component sizes/variants across pages. |
| **Live preview not updating after edits** | Real-time feedback is a marquee feature; if updates lag or fail, users doubt data integrity. | • Implement debounced state sync between form and preview.<br>• Write unit tests for each field → preview mapping.<br>• Show loading/error states when preview cannot refresh. |
| **Signature workflows completely inaccessible** | Signatures are legally required on many invoices; hiding these controls blocks users from completing tasks. | • Ensure signature canvas & typed/upload tabs are visible in default viewport.<br>• Provide fallback text (“Your browser does not support canvas…”) with guidance.<br>• Validate that uploaded images display in preview and PDFs. |
| **Error messages & placeholder text** | Generic or missing placeholders (“Placeholder text”) don’t guide data entry; absent validation messaging leaves users guessing. | • Replace lorem placeholders with real examples (e.g., “ACME Corp.”).<br>• Add inline validation that appears instantly on blur/focus.<br>• Localise copy consistently (avoid mixed “EnglishToggle theme” strings). |
| **Performance/timeout sensitivity** | Sections often loaded after 5-s timeouts in tests. Real users on slower networks will face the same blank screens. | • Lazy-load heavy components only when needed.<br>• Show skeleton loaders while the wizard initialises.<br>• Profile and optimise bundle size. |
| **Export & date formatting errors** | Displaying “Invalid Date” kills trust and blocks export workflows. | • Add date-parsing fallback and locale testing.<br>• Include automated regression tests for date rendering.<br>• Give users manual date picker to correct bad defaults. |

### Priority Action Items

Ranked list of immediate actions to improve the user experience, ordered by impact and feasibility.

1. **Restore visibility of core wizard headings (“Bill From”, “Bill To”, “Line Items”) and add stable data-test-ids.**
2. **Fix date formatting bug that shows “Invalid Date” and blocks dashboards/export.**
3. **Standardise global spacing and button styles to eliminate most ‘looks-off’ UI review flags.**
4. **Ensure signature canvas/component mounts by default; add clear fallback text if unsupported.**
5. **Set up real-time preview state listener to guarantee immediate reflection of form edits.**
