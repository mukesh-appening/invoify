## UX Analysis

*UX analysis data is also available as raw JSON in `ux-analysis.json` in this directory.*

### Emotional Journey

This analysis describes the user's emotional experience throughout the test execution, highlighting moments of confidence, frustration, and satisfaction.

> Initial optimism as site opens quickly ‚Üí immediate confusion when expected invoice sections don‚Äôt appear ‚Üí mounting frustration as repeated attempts (templates, signatures, calculations) dead-end ‚Üí loss of trust when core actions (export, send email) cannot be completed ‚Üí overall disappointment and perception of an unfinished or unstable product.

### Step-by-Step Narrative

Detailed breakdown of each test step with status and key observations from the UX analysis.

| Step | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Homepage loads (all scenarios) | ‚úÖ pass | Browser successfully reaches https://invoify.vercel.app; Core header and action buttons (New Invoice, Next, Toggle theme, etc.) generally visible |
| User expects to start Invoice Wizard ‚Äì key sections missing | ‚ùå fail | ‚ÄúBill From‚Äù / ‚ÄúBill To‚Äù / ‚ÄúLine Items‚Äù / ‚ÄúTax Calculation‚Äù headings not found (timeouts across multiple tests); Wizard navigation button ‚Äò1 . From & To‚Äô not clickable in some runs |
| Template & Logo features | ‚ùå fail | Template picker not visible ‚Üí cannot switch templates; Logo upload control never located |
| Live-preview interaction | ‚ùå mixed | Initial live-preview panel appears, but dynamic updates often fail (changes in form fields not reflected); Wizard-step synchronisation breaks at first navigation |
| Signature workflows (draw / type / upload) | ‚ùå fail | Canvas, typed-signature input, and upload zone all missing, causing early exits |
| Financial calculations (line-items, tax, discount, shipping) | ‚ùå fail | Related UI sections not rendered; therefore calculations never start |
| Export & distribution (PDF, email, JSON/CSV/XML) | ‚ùå fail | Export buttons seen, but PDF generation step fails because prerequisite invoice data not present; Email distribution test stops‚Äîdashboard label ‚ÄòDashboard‚Äô not detected |
| Internationalisation (language, currency, date) | ‚ùå fail | Language switcher button (‚ÄòBETA English‚Äô) not found so locale switch impossible; Currency selector absent; date formatting shows ‚ÄòInvalid Date‚Äô |
| Visual QA observations (all pages) | ‚ùå fail | Mis-aligned labels & inputs, inconsistent padding/margins, buttons vary in size/style, placeholder copy not helpful |

### Qualitative Improvement Opportunities

Identified areas for UX improvement with rationale and actionable next steps.

| Area | Why It Matters | Next Actions |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| **Critical rendering of core wizard sections** | If ‚ÄòBill From‚Äô, ‚ÄòBill To‚Äô, ‚ÄòLine Items‚Äô, etc. don‚Äôt load, users cannot create invoices‚Äîprimary product promise broken. | ‚Ä¢ Audit component mounting logic and route guards; ensure sections load on first paint.<br>‚Ä¢ Add automated smoke test that asserts presence of each wizard step before deploying. |
| **Element discoverability & semantic markup** | Tests (and likely real users using screen-readers or search) fail to find controls like language switcher, currency picker, logo upload area. | ‚Ä¢ Add explicit labels/aria attributes and stable text for headings and buttons.<br>‚Ä¢ Use predictable IDs / roles for interactive widgets. |
| **Real-time data binding in live preview** | Users expect WYSIWYG behaviour; delays or failures break mental model and lower confidence. | ‚Ä¢ Debounce but don‚Äôt block state updates; unit-test each field for preview propagation.<br>‚Ä¢ Provide loading or error indicator if binding fails. |
| **Visual consistency (padding, alignment, button styles)** | Inconsistent UI erodes professionalism and makes forms harder to scan quickly. | ‚Ä¢ Adopt a design system / spacing scale; run a UI linter before merge.<br>‚Ä¢ Standardise button component variants and apply across app. |
| **Feedback & validation messaging** | Users get no clue why an action didn‚Äôt work (e.g., invalid file upload, failed PDF generation). | ‚Ä¢ Surface inline validation and toast notifications for all critical actions.<br>‚Ä¢ Include success states (e.g., ‚ÄòPDF generated ‚Äì download will start‚Äô). |
| **Placeholder & copy quality** | Non-descriptive placeholders slow data entry and look unpolished. | ‚Ä¢ Replace lorem placeholders with example data (‚Äòe.g., Acme Ltd.‚Äô).<br>‚Ä¢ Pass all text through copy edit for clarity. |

### Priority Action Items

Ranked list of immediate actions to improve the user experience, ordered by impact and feasibility.

1. **Ensure all wizard steps (Bill From/To, Line Items, Calculations) render by default‚Äîgate-keeps nearly every blocked flow.**
2. **Add stable text/aria labels to key controls (language, currency, template, logo upload) so they are discoverable and automation-friendly.**
3. **Fix live preview binding for a single field and show spinner/error‚Äîquickly boosts perceived responsiveness.**
4. **Standardise padding/margins and button styles using a small CSS refactor‚Äîvisible quality lift with low engineering effort.**
5. **Replace generic placeholders with meaningful examples to guide first-time users.**
