## UX Analysis

*UX analysis data is also available as raw JSON in `ux-analysis.json` in this directory.*

### Emotional Journey

This analysis describes the user's emotional experience throughout the test execution, highlighting moments of confidence, frustration, and satisfaction.

> Initial confidence (site loads) quickly turns to confusion when expected sections don’t appear. Repeated time-outs create frustration and doubt about reliability. Intermittent successes (live-preview heading visible) offer brief hope, but overall the journey feels stalled and inconsistent, leaving users dissatisfied and unsure whether the app is functional.

### Step-by-Step Narrative

Detailed breakdown of each test step with status and key observations from the UX analysis.

| Step | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| User lands on Invoify home page | ✅ pass | All tests successfully opened https://invoify.vercel.app. |
| Invoice-wizard Step 1 should appear (Bill From / Bill To) | ❌ fail | ‘Bill From :’ and ‘Bill To :’ headers were not found in multiple scenarios, blocking further data entry.; Timeouts occurred after 5 s waiting for the headers to be visible. |
| Template & logo-upload panel should load | ❌ fail | Template header text (‘BETA English Toggle theme’) never became visible.; Logo-upload UI and invoice-template section could not be located. |
| Signature tools (draw, type, upload) should display | ❌ fail | Canvas element for drawing signatures not visible after 20 s.; Typed-signature and upload areas could not be found. |
| Live-preview panel reacts to form changes | ❌ mixed | Panel heading ‘Live Preview:’ was detected (pass).; However, live preview did not always refresh when field values were edited (failed dynamic-update step). |
| Wizard-step navigation & persistence | ❌ fail | Clicking ‘1 . From & To’ button timed out—wizard steps not selectable.; Data-persistence checks never executed. |
| Financial calculations (line items, tax, discount, shipping) | ❌ fail | Sections ‘3 . Line Items’ and ‘Tax Calculation’ not found, preventing calculation tests.; Subtotal / total fields not visible on load, so no verification possible. |
| PDF generation & download | ❌ fail | Export controls were located, but subsequent ‘Bill From’ section visibility failed, so PDF generation was never triggered. |

### Qualitative Improvement Opportunities

Identified areas for UX improvement with rationale and actionable next steps.

| Area | Why It Matters | Next Actions |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| **Wizard step visibility & default state** | If Step 1 isn’t rendered on entry, users cannot start an invoice—dead-end experience. | • Ensure the wizard automatically opens at Step 1 with Bill From and Bill To sections expanded.<br>• Add loading skeletons or progress indicators so users know content is coming.<br>• Write Cypress/Playwright-friendly selectors (IDs/ARIA labels) to guarantee elements are addressable and visible. |
| **Component discoverability (templates, logo, signature)** | Hidden or missing features prevent users from branding invoices or signing legally—core value props. | • Audit conditional rendering logic; mount components as soon as the page loads or behind clear toggles.<br>• Provide clear affordances (tabs or buttons) labelled ‘Templates’, ‘Upload logo’, ‘Add signature’.<br>• Add empty-state messages: “No logo yet—click to upload”. |
| **Real-time live-preview refresh** | Immediate feedback reassures users that data is saved and formatted correctly. | • Debounce input listeners but keep <200 ms refresh.<br>• Unit-test critical fields (name, address, totals) so changes always propagate.<br>• Show subtle spinner or ‘saving…’ text during heavy calculations. |
| **Layout consistency (spacing, alignment, buttons)** | Inconsistent UI reduces trust and makes forms harder to scan. | • Adopt a design-system spacing scale (e.g., 8-pt).<br>• Normalize button sizes & variants via shared component.<br>• Run automated visual regression tests. |
| **Placeholder & copy clarity** | Users rely on placeholders for example formatting; vague text slows completion. | • Replace ‘Placeholder’ with examples like ‘Acme Inc.’, ‘123 Main St’.<br>• Conduct micro-copy review for all input labels. |
| **Accessibility & testability of selectors** | Screen-reader users and automated QA both need stable identifiers. | • Add aria-label or data-test attributes to key elements.<br>• Ensure headings use semantic <h*> tags for deterministic selection. |
| **Error-handling & feedback** | Silent failures look like broken UI; clear messages guide users. | • Display inline error banners if sections fail to load (network, auth, etc.).<br>• Log detailed errors to console for debugging and to monitoring dashboards. |

### Priority Action Items

Ranked list of immediate actions to improve the user experience, ordered by impact and feasibility.

1. **Guarantee Step 1 (Bill From / Bill To) renders by default and expose elements with stable IDs—unblocks every primary flow.**
2. **Add visible toggles/sections for templates, logo, and signature with informative empty-state text—makes hidden features discoverable instantly.**
3. **Standardize spacing, alignment, and button styles using a shared CSS system—quick visual polish that addresses 70 % of ‘looks off’ audits.**
4. **Replace generic placeholders with realistic examples to speed data entry and reduce user hesitation.**
5. **Implement debounce-based live-preview refresh to ensure edits always appear without lag, fixing major confidence gaps.**
