## UX Analysis

*UX analysis data is also available as raw JSON in `ux-analysis.json` in this directory.*

### Emotional Journey

This analysis describes the user's emotional experience throughout the test execution, highlighting moments of confidence, frustration, and satisfaction.

> The user starts confident when the site loads, but quickly hits a wall‚Äîcore wizard sections do not appear, creating confusion (‚ÄúIs something broken or am I in the wrong place?‚Äù). Repeated 5-second stalls lead to frustration and abandonment. Minor visual/copy issues further erode trust, but the dominant feeling is blockage rather than polish.

### Step-by-Step Narrative

Detailed breakdown of each test step with status and key observations from the UX analysis.

| Step | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Launch Invoify app | ‚úÖ pass | All three test flows successfully loaded https://invoify.vercel.app in a new browser tab. |
| Invoice Wizard ‚Äì Bill From section should appear (Step 1) | ‚ùå fail | The UI never exposed an element that matched the text selector ‚ÄúBill From :‚Äù.; Automation timed-out after 5 s, so the remaining Bill From interactions (field entry, validation, persistence) never executed. |
| Invoice Wizard ‚Äì Bill To section should appear (Step 1) | ‚ùå fail | Similar to Bill From, the expected heading ‚ÄúBill To :‚Äù was not rendered/detected within 5 s, stopping the rest of the Bill To test path. |
| Landing page main interface / header visibility | ‚ùå fail | Template-selection flow expected a header reading ‚ÄúBETA English Toggle theme‚Äù. No such element became visible within 5 s. |
| UI micro-copy & visual audit (automatic) | ‚ùå pass-with-notes | Spell-checking & content-placement: Placeholder text flagged as not informative.; Visual consistency: Button sizes & styles vary across templates. |

### Qualitative Improvement Opportunities

Identified areas for UX improvement with rationale and actionable next steps.

| Area | Why It Matters | Next Actions |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| **Wizard entry point (Bill From / Bill To visibility)** | If first-step headings aren‚Äôt rendered or are hidden off-screen, users cannot start an invoice‚Äîthis is a hard stop that drives abandonment. | ‚Ä¢ Ensure the wizard automatically opens on Step 1 when the page loads.<br>‚Ä¢ Use persistent, semantic headings (<h4 Bill From>) so both humans and assistive tech can locate sections.<br>‚Ä¢ Add skeleton loaders or progress indicators if data is still loading. |
| **Timing & performance of first render** | 5-second blank states feel broken; users will refresh or leave. | ‚Ä¢ Audit network requests & lazy-loading strategy for the wizard component.<br>‚Ä¢ Defer non-critical scripts to prioritise first meaningful paint.<br>‚Ä¢ Set a generous server-side timeout fallback that shows helpful messaging (‚ÄúStill loading‚Ä¶‚Äù) rather than nothing. |
| **Micro-copy: placeholder & instruction text** | Uninformative placeholders reduce form-fill accuracy and perceived professionalism. | ‚Ä¢ Replace lorem/blank placeholders with concrete examples (e.g., ‚ÄúACME Corp, 123 Main St‚Äù).<br>‚Ä¢ Run a content style-guide check for each input. |
| **Visual consistency ‚Äì buttons & UI controls** | Inconsistent button sizing colours makes the product look unpolished and damages trust. | ‚Ä¢ Adopt a design-tokens system or component library to standardise button variants.<br>‚Ä¢ Audit existing templates for rogue CSS overrides. |
| **Selector stability for automation & accessibility** | Fragile selectors break E2E tests and can hint at equally fragile accessibility semantics. | ‚Ä¢ Add data-testids or aria-labels to critical elements (wizard headings, navigation buttons).<br>‚Ä¢ Run an a11y audit (e.g., axe) to ensure correct landmark and heading structure. |

### Priority Action Items

Ranked list of immediate actions to improve the user experience, ordered by impact and feasibility.

1. **Guarantee the wizard opens on Step 1 with visible, semantically tagged Bill From and Bill To headings.**
2. **Add clear loading state or increase initial render performance to avoid 5-second blank screen.**
3. **Introduce stable data-testids/aria-labels for key elements to unblock automation and improve accessibility.**
4. **Replace generic placeholder text with real-world examples for all form fields.**
5. **Apply a unified button component across templates to fix visual inconsistency quickly.**
