## UX Analysis

*UX analysis data is also available as raw JSON in `ux-analysis.json` in this directory.*

### Emotional Journey

This analysis describes the user's emotional experience throughout the test execution, highlighting moments of confidence, frustration, and satisfaction.

> The journey starts with confidence (site loads) but quickly turns into repeated frustration as primary wizard sections fail to appear. Any motivation drops further when template actions and logo upload are unreachable. Only the live-preview flow gives a brief moment of success before breaking on edits, leaving the shopper doubtful about the product’s reliability.

### Step-by-Step Narrative

Detailed breakdown of each test step with status and key observations from the UX analysis.

| Step | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Open https://invoify.vercel.app | ✅ pass | All five automated scenarios were able to launch the site without network or availability issues.; Baseline UI review ran (9 checks each) and only minor visual nits were found at this stage. |
| Invoice Wizard ‑ “Bill From” (Step 1) | ❌ fail | Test: “Invoice Creation – Step 1 Bill From Section”.; Hard failure: the locator looking for the heading “Bill From :” never appeared (5 s timeout).; Because the wizard never surfaced, every downstream action (form fill, validation, persistence checks) remained pending. |
| Invoice Wizard ‑ “Bill To” (Step 1) | ❌ fail | Test: “Invoice Creation – Step 1 Bill To Section”.; Same pattern as above – the heading “Bill To :” was not found, blocking the entire flow.; UI lint noted un-helpful placeholder copy (“Placeholder text is not informative”). |
| Template Selection | ❌ fail | Test: “Template System – Template Selection”.; The expected header string (“BETA English Toggle theme”) never became visible. User cannot reach template cards or live preview switcher.; Visual lint flagged style inconsistency across buttons. |
| Logo Upload in Templates | ❌ fail | Test: “Template System – Logo Upload”.; Could not locate the template section exposing a logo-upload control; flow stopped at step 2.; Separate UI check also reported that the logo upload option is missing in the current viewport. |
| Live Preview ‑ Real-time Updates | ❌ partial-fail | User successfully filled both Bill From and Bill To forms; initial live preview rendered their data (steps 1-5 pass).; When the same fields were edited, some updates (e.g., Zip, Address) failed to propagate to the preview, producing a hard failure at step 6.; Multiple visual comments flagged mis-aligned labels, inconsistent spacing/padding. |

### Qualitative Improvement Opportunities

Identified areas for UX improvement with rationale and actionable next steps.

| Area | Why It Matters | Next Actions |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| **Core wizard visibility (“Bill From / Bill To” headings)** | Customers cannot create an invoice if the very first step never renders—this is a show-stopper. | • Audit component mounting logic and selectors; ensure headings render inside a stable container.<br>• Add skeleton loaders or progress indicator so users know the wizard is loading.<br>• Extend automated tests to capture console errors for quicker root-cause discovery. |
| **Template area & logo upload discoverability** | Switching templates and adding a logo are high-value personalization features; if users can’t find them, perceived product depth plummets. | • Verify that template cards and the logo-upload control are always present in the DOM (even before data loads).<br>• Surface the logo control near the company name or in a clearly-labelled “Branding” section.<br>• Add micro-copy tooltips or guided walkthrough highlighting where to change templates and upload a logo. |
| **Live preview two-way binding** | Instant feedback is a selling point; failures break trust and create doubt about what will actually be sent to clients. | • Review state management: ensure every field change triggers a preview refresh (watch for debouncing / incorrect field names).<br>• Add unit tests for each field → preview mapping to catch regressions.<br>• Show a subtle spinner or highlight in the preview when data is updating so users can see the connection. |
| **Visual consistency (spacing, alignment, button styles)** | Uneven UI cues undermine brand polish and can slow users down as they scan forms. | • Adopt a layout grid / spacing scale and refactor styles to reference tokens instead of ad-hoc values.<br>• Run an automated visual regression test (e.g., Percy) after each release.<br>• Standardize button component variants and reuse across pages. |
| **Placeholder & helper text quality** | Good examples speed up data entry and reduce errors; vague placeholders make forms intimidating. | • Swap lorem placeholders with realistic example data (e.g., “Acme Inc.”, “steve@acme.com”).<br>• Add helper hints for tricky fields like tax IDs or phone format.<br>• Run a quick content audit to ensure every required field has either a placeholder or inline label. |

### Priority Action Items

Ranked list of immediate actions to improve the user experience, ordered by impact and feasibility.

1. **Fix rendering/selector issue that hides “Bill From” and “Bill To” sections (blocks multiple flows).**
2. **Ensure every form field change re-renders in live preview (tighten data binding).**
3. **Make template cards and logo-upload control permanently visible and reachable.**
4. **Standardize spacing and button styles using a design token system for immediate visual polish.**
5. **Replace placeholder lorem text with real examples to guide first-time users.**
