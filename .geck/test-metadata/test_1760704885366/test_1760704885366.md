## UX Analysis

*UX analysis data is also available as raw JSON in `ux-analysis.json` in this directory.*

### Emotional Journey

This analysis describes the user's emotional experience throughout the test execution, highlighting moments of confidence, frustration, and satisfaction.

> Real shoppers would start with optimism (page loads) but very quickly hit a wall: essential wizard sections never appear or take too long ‚Üí immediate confusion and mistrust. Those who do reach the form encounter alignment/padding quirks that feel unpolished. Live preview sometimes lags, eroding confidence that edits save. Inconsistent button styling and missing language toggle add to an overall sense of an unfinished beta.

### Step-by-Step Narrative

Detailed breakdown of each test step with status and key observations from the UX analysis.

| Step | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Landing on Invoify home (all tests ‚Äì Step 1) | ‚úÖ pass | Browser opens and reaches https://invoify.vercel.app.; Basic header and hero elements render, though automated UI review already flags minor layout / typography inconsistencies. |
| Trying to start the invoice-creation wizard | ‚ùå fail | Across ‚ÄòBill From‚Äô, ‚ÄòBill To‚Äô, line-item, tax, discount and PDF tests the very first assertion that a wizard section is visible times-out.; Typical locator failures: ‚ÄúBill From :‚Äù, ‚ÄúBill To :‚Äù, ‚Äú1 . From & To‚Äù, ‚Äú3 . Line Items‚Äù.; Result: No subsequent form-filling, validation or navigation steps are executed (all marked pending). |
| Template & Logo related flows | ‚ùå fail | UI header (‚ÄúBETA English Toggle theme‚Äù) not found; therefore template list, logo upload, live preview cannot be located.; All deeper steps (choose template, upload logo, verify persistence) remain pending. |
| Live preview real-time update flow | ‚ùå mixed | Script can type into form fields and see a preview panel (‚ÄúLive Preview:‚Äù heading).; When fields are modified, at least one crucial value (Zip) fails to update; step flagged as fail. |
| Export / email / i18n flows | ‚ùå fail | Dashboard text (‚ÄúDashboard‚Äù, language switcher) or date formats not present, so export/email tests abort early.; PDF generation and multi-format export never reached. |
| Common UI review observations (automatic) | ‚úÖ pass | Repeated cosmetic ‚Äòlooks off‚Äô flags: mis-aligned inputs & labels, inconsistent padding/margins, button style variance, placeholder copy too generic. |

### Qualitative Improvement Opportunities

Identified areas for UX improvement with rationale and actionable next steps.

| Area | Why It Matters | Next Actions |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| **Critical content not rendering / selector mismatch** | Customers can‚Äôt even begin key tasks (enter Bill From/Bill To, add line items, taxes, etc.). They will abandon immediately. | ‚Ä¢ Audit component mounting logic‚Äîare sections hidden behind feature flags or route guards?<br>‚Ä¢ Add explicit page-level loading skeletons or spinners so users know content is coming.<br>‚Ä¢ Stabilise element text & IDs; expose data-test attributes so minor copy tweaks don‚Äôt break rendering or tests. |
| **Perceived performance (5 s timeouts consistently hit)** | Waiting for invisible elements feels like a crash; poor FID hurts SEO & user trust. | ‚Ä¢ Lazy-load heavy components after first meaningful paint.<br>‚Ä¢ Defer unnecessary fonts/scripts; prioritise wizard HTML in initial bundle.<br>‚Ä¢ Instrument TTI and add performance budgets in CI. |
| **Layout consistency (spacing, alignment, button styles)** | Visual inconsistency signals low quality and can slow data entry. | ‚Ä¢ Adopt a design-token system (spacing scale, type ramp).<br>‚Ä¢ Run a UI regression tool (Storybook + Chromatic) to catch drift.<br>‚Ä¢ Audit tailwind/utility classes for duplicated overrides. |
| **Form validation & live preview sync** | Users rely on instant feedback to avoid billing errors; mismatches breed frustration and mistrust. | ‚Ä¢ Debounce preview rendering but ensure change-event updates every bound field.<br>‚Ä¢ Add field-level validation hints (e.g., green ticks) so users see success, not only errors.<br>‚Ä¢ Write unit tests for computed totals, taxes, discounts. |
| **Copy & placeholder clarity** | Generic placeholders (‚ÄòName‚Ä¶‚Äô) give no clue about desired format; causes user hesitation. | ‚Ä¢ Replace lorem / generic placeholders with realistic examples (e.g., ‚ÄúACME Corp.‚Äù, ‚Äú123-456-7890‚Äù).<br>‚Ä¢ Review microcopy for spelling and parallel structure. |
| **Accessibility & Internationalization controls** | Language-switch and header text fail to appear; non-English users blocked. | ‚Ä¢ Ensure language picker is in DOM on first load; fallback language strings should be complete.<br>‚Ä¢ Add aria-labels to dynamic buttons and ensure focus order after language change. |

### Priority Action Items

Ranked list of immediate actions to improve the user experience, ordered by impact and feasibility.

1. **Guarantee wizard sections mount immediately‚Äîadd deterministic IDs / data-test attributes and remove copy-dependent selectors.**
2. **Introduce visible loading states to avoid ‚Äòblank screen‚Äô during async component fetch.**
3. **Standardise spacing / button styles via a shared design system token file‚Äîquick CSS pass will remove majority of ‚Äòlooks off‚Äô flags.**
4. **Fix live preview binding for all fields (easiest repro: Zip) and add unit tests to prevent regression.**
5. **Replace placeholder copy with realistic examples and proof-read for spelling; low effort, high perceived polish.**
