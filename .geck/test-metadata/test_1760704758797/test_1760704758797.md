## UX Analysis

*UX analysis data is also available as raw JSON in `ux-analysis.json` in this directory.*

### Emotional Journey

This analysis describes the user's emotional experience throughout the test execution, highlighting moments of confidence, frustration, and satisfaction.

> Hopeful on first page load → confusion when expected sections never appear → repeated frustration/timeouts → brief relief when live preview initially works → disappointment when dynamic updates break → overall loss of confidence, likely abandonment.

### Step-by-Step Narrative

Detailed breakdown of each test step with status and key observations from the UX analysis.

| Step | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Landing on invoify.vercel.app | ✅ pass | Every scenario successfully opened the homepage. Good first impression: fast load, logo & primary CTA visible. |
| Trying to start Invoice Wizard – Step 1 (Bill From / Bill To) | ❌ fail | Both ‘Bill From :’ and ‘Bill To :’ headers never became visible → tests timed-out.; User cannot move forward, so all downstream validation, persistence, and navigation checks were skipped. |
| Template gallery & logo upload | ❌ fail | Header inside landing page ('BETA English Toggle theme') did not render, so template list wasn’t reached.; Logo-upload control could not be found. |
| Live preview (basic fill works, dynamic update fails) | ❌ mixed | User managed to fill both Bill-From & Bill-To forms and saw data appear in preview (pass).; Updating values later did NOT refresh preview (fail). |
| Wizard-step synchronisation with preview | ❌ fail | Wizard navigation button ‘1 . From & To’ never responded → preview sync never evaluated. |
| Signature features (draw / type / upload) | ❌ fail | Canvas for drawing signature, typed-signature area, and image-upload zone were all missing or hidden. |
| Financial calculations (Line Items, Tax, Discount, Shipping) | ❌ fail | ‘Line Items’ section, ‘Tax Calculation’ block, and subtotal fields were not found, so no calculations could be tested. |
| Global visual QA observations | ❌ pass-with-issues | Automated UI review flagged repeated cosmetic issues: inconsistent padding & margins, mis-aligned labels, varying button styles, weak placeholder copy. |

### Qualitative Improvement Opportunities

Identified areas for UX improvement with rationale and actionable next steps.

| Area | Why It Matters | Next Actions |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| **Critical content not rendered / discoverability of key sections** | Users cannot progress or even see core functionality (Bill From/To, Line Items, Tax, Signatures). Blocks conversion entirely. | • Audit React/component mounting logic and conditional rendering—ensure sections are inserted into DOM on first load.<br>• Add loading skeletons or status indicators so users know content is coming.<br>• Set explicit heights/anchors so off-screen sections can be scrolled to and discovered.<br>• Add automated smoke test to fail CI when headers are missing. |
| **Wizard navigation / step state management** | Inability to jump between steps or persist data makes multi-step flow feel brittle and forces restart. | • Keep step buttons always enabled/visible; disable only with clear explanation.<br>• Store step data in global form state (e.g., context) and restore on return.<br>• Highlight current step in UI to orient the user. |
| **Real-time preview & data binding** | Live preview is the product’s ‘magic moment’. Lag or failure erodes trust and causes manual re-checks. | • Debounce input updates but ensure one-way data flow to preview; add unit tests on key fields.<br>• Provide subtle loading indicator inside preview when update is in progress.<br>• Log to console when binding fails to aid debugging. |
| **Signature & logo controls visibility** | Branding & sign-off are legally required for invoices; if users can’t find these, they will churn. | • Surface these actions in dedicated ‘Branding’ section; use universally recognised icons (pen, image upload).<br>• Add placeholder guidance text like “Drag or click to add your signature”.<br>• Support JPG/PNG/SVG & give immediate feedback on invalid files. |
| **Visual consistency (spacing, alignment, button styles)** | Small visual polish signals professionalism and reduces cognitive load. | • Adopt a spacing scale (4-pt or 8-pt) and apply via design tokens.<br>• Run a CSS linter or style-lint for button component variations.<br>• Align labels with inputs using flex/grid; test responsive breakpoints. |
| **Copy & placeholders** | Informative placeholders accelerate form filling and reduce errors. | • Replace lorem/weak copy with concrete examples (‘e.g. Acme Corp’) and formatting hints (‘+1 (555) 123-4567’).<br>• Proof-read for spelling & case consistency. |
| **Error & empty-state messaging** | Current timeouts feel like the app froze. Human-friendly messages keep users engaged. | • Display inline errors when a section fails to load (e.g., “Can’t find Line Items, retry?”).<br>• Offer retry/refresh CTA instead of silent failure. |

### Priority Action Items

Ranked list of immediate actions to improve the user experience, ordered by impact and feasibility.

1. **Ensure ‘Bill From’, ‘Bill To’, ‘Line Items’, ‘Tax’ headers render on initial load (fix conditional rendering & provide fallback).**
2. **Wire real-time preview to always update on field change; add unit test coverage for data-binding.**
3. **Introduce a global spacing & button style guide; update CSS variables to eliminate padding/alignment inconsistencies.**
4. **Add clear, descriptive placeholders & helper text to all inputs for faster onboarding.**
5. **Make signature/logo upload controls always visible with clear icons and drag-and-drop support.**
