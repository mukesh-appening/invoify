## UX Analysis

### Emotional Journey

This analysis describes the user's emotional experience throughout the test execution, highlighting moments of confidence, frustration, and satisfaction.

> Hopeful when the app loads ‚Üí immediate confusion when key sections never show up ‚Üí irritation as repeated refreshes/time-outs occur ‚Üí partial relief when live preview works for initial input ‚Üí frustration returns when edits don‚Äôt update and other core features (templates, signatures, calculations) simply aren‚Äôt there ‚Üí loss of confidence / abandonment.

### Step-by-Step Narrative

Detailed breakdown of each test step with status and key observations from the UX analysis.

| Step | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Launch & landing page | ‚úÖ pass | Every test starts with the user opening https://invoify.vercel.app.; The landing page usually renders, but UI-review repeatedly flags minor style issues (mis-aligned labels, inconsistent padding, vague placeholder text, button style drift). |
| Trying to start Invoice Wizard ‚Äì Step 1 (Bill From / Bill To) | ‚ùå fail | Users expect the wizard to open on Step 1.; Both ‚ÄòBill From‚Äô and ‚ÄòBill To‚Äô sections fail to appear within 5 s, so the journey stops before any data entry.; Hard failure source: component not mounted or selector mismatch. |
| Template system (choose template / upload logo) | ‚ùå fail | Landing page header never becomes visible ‚Üí template choices not reachable.; Logo-upload option cannot be found once page loads ‚Üí user cannot brand their invoice. |
| Live preview (real-time data & step sync) | ‚ùå mixed (pass ‚Üí fail) | User successfully types full Bill From / Bill To data and sees it in preview (good).; When they change values, at least one field (‚ÄòZip‚Äô in test) does not re-render ‚Üí trust in ‚Äúlive‚Äù preview drops.; Navigation buttons (‚Äò1 . From & To‚Äô) sometimes unclickable, so preview cannot sync with wizard steps. |
| Signature features (draw, type, upload) | ‚ùå fail | Canvas for drawing signature, typed-signature field, and upload area are all missing or not visible ‚Üí user cannot add any signature. |
| Line-item calculations | ‚ùå fail | ‚ÄòLine Items‚Äô section never appears, so quantity √ó price totals cannot be tested. |

### Qualitative Improvement Opportunities

Identified areas for UX improvement with rationale and actionable next steps.

| Area | Why It Matters | Next Actions |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| **Critical UI elements not rendering (wizard sections, signature areas, templates, line-items)** | Blocks users from completing primary tasks; leads to instant churn. | ‚Ä¢ Audit component mounting & conditional rendering logic; ensure sections always mount even if data is empty.<br>‚Ä¢ Add robust loading states / skeletons so users know something is happening.<br>‚Ä¢ Implement automated smoke test that asserts presence of every major section on first paint. |
| **Selector / label mismatches causing automated & human findability issues** | If automation can‚Äôt locate ‚ÄòBill From‚Äô, real users may also miss it; inconsistent labels hurt accessibility. | ‚Ä¢ Standardise text labels (‚ÄòBill From:‚Äô not ‚ÄòBill From  :‚Äô) and use semantic headings.<br>‚Ä¢ Expose test-friendly data-attributes (e.g., data-testid) to decouple DOM changes from selectors.<br>‚Ä¢ Run accessibility audit for ARIA landmarks so sections are discoverable by assistive tech. |
| **Live preview not consistently updating** | Users rely on WYSIWYG feedback; stale data undermines trust and can generate billing errors. | ‚Ä¢ Track down state propagation for every field; add unit tests for each field‚Äìpreview binding.<br>‚Ä¢ Throttle/debounce input updates if performance is a concern, but guarantee final value sync.<br>‚Ä¢ Show ‚Äòout of sync‚Äô indicator when binding fails. |
| **Visual consistency (spacing, alignment, button styles, placeholder copy)** | Polish signals reliability; inconsistent UI makes the product feel unfinished and distracts from the task. | ‚Ä¢ Adopt a design-system/utility-class approach (e.g., Tailwind spacing scale).<br>‚Ä¢ Normalize button component variants and enforce via linting/storybook.<br>‚Ä¢ Replace lorem or vague placeholders with real examples (e.g., ‚ÄúAcme Co.‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúName‚Äù). |
| **Signature workflows (draw, type, upload) missing** | A legally binding invoice must be signable; absence forces users to seek other tools. | ‚Ä¢ Verify signature feature flags aren‚Äôt accidentally off in prod build.<br>‚Ä¢ If feature is not yet supported, hide menu entries and communicate roadmap.<br>‚Ä¢ Add fallback typed name + timestamp if canvas unavailable. |
| **Wizard navigation controls unresponsive** | Users can‚Äôt progress, review, or edit steps. | ‚Ä¢ Increase hit-area and ensure buttons are enabled once current step validation passes.<br>‚Ä¢ Use sticky progress bar so navigation is always visible.<br>‚Ä¢ Log navigation errors in analytics to catch in production. |

### Priority Action Items

Ranked list of immediate actions to improve the user experience, ordered by impact and feasibility.

1. **Guarantee core sections mount on initial load (Bill From, Bill To, Line Items, Signature, Template chooser). Smoke-test nightly.**
2. **Introduce stable data-testids & clean up heading/label text so both users and automation can reliably find elements.**
3. **Fix state binding for live-preview updates (start with fields that currently fail like Zip/Address).**
4. **Apply global spacing & button style tokens to resolve majority of ‚Äòlooks off‚Äô UI-review flags quickly.**
5. **Hide or clearly mark unfinished features (signature types, logo upload) until fully functional to avoid user confusion.**
