### Emotional Journey

This analysis describes the user's emotional experience throughout the test execution, highlighting moments of confidence, frustration, and satisfaction.

> Starts curious/confident when the site loads. Quickly turns to confusion when the expected wizard or controls aren‚Äôt visible. Repeated time-outs create frustration and doubt about site reliability. Because no task can be completed, the session ends in disappointment and low trust.

### Step-by-Step Narrative

Detailed breakdown of each test step with status and key observations from the UX analysis.

| Step | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Test 1 ‚Äì Invoice Creation : Bill From section | ‚ùå fail | Step 1 ‚Äì Landing page opens (pass).; Step 2 ‚Äì Expected ‚ÄúBill From:‚Äù block never appears ‚Üí test stops here (hard failure).; Steps 3-10 ‚Äì Never executed. |

### Qualitative Improvement Opportunities

Identified areas for UX improvement with rationale and actionable next steps.

| Area | Why It Matters | Next Actions |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| **First-run flow / discoverability of Invoice Wizard** | Users expect to start creating an invoice immediately; hiding the wizard or requiring an undiscoverable click creates an early abandonment risk. | ‚Ä¢ Auto-launch Step 1 after landing or surface a prominent ‚ÄúCreate Invoice‚Äù CTA.<br>‚Ä¢ Add a visible progress indicator while wizard assets load. |
| **Section headings used as primary selectors ("Bill From :", "Bill To :")** | Extra spaces/colons or copy edits break automated tests and confuse AT users; can also hurt localisation. | ‚Ä¢ Replace brittle text selectors with stable data-testids / ARIA-labels.<br>‚Ä¢ Standardise heading copy without trailing spaces/colon. |
| **Placeholder text quality** | Placeholders guide users; non-informative lorem text looks unfinished and reduces professionalism. | ‚Ä¢ Provide meaningful examples (e.g., ‚ÄúAcme Corp, 123 Main St‚Äù).<br>‚Ä¢ Audit all inputs for helpful micro-copy. |
| **Visual consistency of buttons and controls** | Inconsistent sizing/styling decreases perceived polish and can impact trust. | ‚Ä¢ Define a button component in design system; apply consistently across templates.<br>‚Ä¢ Run visual regression tests after each template addition. |
| **Logo upload control discoverability** | Branding the invoice is a key value prop; if users can‚Äôt find the feature they‚Äôll assume it‚Äôs missing. | ‚Ä¢ Place the logo control near template preview with an upload icon & ‚ÄúAdd logo‚Äù label.<br>‚Ä¢ Add tooltip/help text describing accepted formats and size.<br>‚Ä¢ Persist uploaded logo across template switches. |
| **Load-time expectations vs reality** | 5-second time-outs suggest the UI might be slow or scripts heavy; users perceive slowness as instability. | ‚Ä¢ Measure real world TTI for wizard sections; optimise or add skeleton loaders.<br>‚Ä¢ Extend automated-test waitFor where appropriate. |

### Priority Action Items

Ranked list of immediate actions to improve the user experience, ordered by impact and feasibility.

1. **Add stable data-testid / aria-labels to key sections (Bill From, Bill To, template picker, logo uploader) to stop hard failures and improve accessibility.**
2. **Expose a clear, immediate ‚ÄúCreate Invoice‚Äù button that launches the wizard without extra clicks.**
3. **Replace placeholder/lorem copy with concrete examples across all input fields.**
4. **Standardise button styles via a shared component so all templates look coherent.**
5. **Make the logo upload control obvious (icon + label) and ensure the logo persists when switching templates.**
