## UX Analysis

*UX analysis data is also available as raw JSON in `ux-analysis.json` in this directory.*

### Emotional Journey

This analysis describes the user's emotional experience throughout the test execution, highlighting moments of confidence, frustration, and satisfaction.

> Initial confidence (site loads) quickly drops to frustration when core sections like “Bill From / Bill To” never appear. Continued attempts to explore features (templates, signatures, calculations) produce repeated dead-ends, eroding trust. A brief moment of relief occurs when responsive resizing works, but visual polish issues still leave the shopper with low confidence and a sense that the product is unfinished.

### Step-by-Step Narrative

Detailed breakdown of each test step with status and key observations from the UX analysis.

| Step | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Landing on the application | ✅ pass | Every test was able to reach https://invoify.vercel.app without issue.; Basic header ("BETA English Toggle theme") and primary buttons generally rendered. |
| Invoice creation – “Bill From / Bill To” (Step 1) | ❌ fail | Both tests looking for the “Bill From :” and “Bill To :” headers timed-out (5 s) – locator could not find the h4 elements.; Subsequent form-fill, validation, and data-persistence steps were never executed. |
| Template system – choosing template & uploading logo | ❌ fail | UI failed to expose expected template names (“Template 1 / Template 2”) or the logo-upload control.; Live preview header could not be located → tests aborted before verifying preview refresh. |
| Live preview – real-time update & wizard sync | ❌ partial fail | Initial data entry reflected in preview (pass), but later edits did NOT propagate – validation failed after several retries.; Another test could not click the step button labelled “1 . From & To”, suggesting wizard buttons are off-screen or mislabeled. |
| Signature system – draw, type & upload | ❌ fail | Canvas element (‘<canvas>’) never became visible within 20 s.; Typed-signature and image-upload sections were not found; tests aborted early. |
| Financial calculations – line items, tax, discount, shipping | ❌ fail | Sections labelled “3 . Line Items” and “Tax Calculation” were not detected; therefore auto-calculation logic was never exercised.; Discount/shipping test could not even find default subtotal fields (“Subtotal: 0.00 USD”). |
| Export & distribution – PDF, email, JSON/CSV/XML | ❌ fail | PDF test stalled because "Bill From :" section (still missing) prevented accessing Generate PDF flow.; Email distribution test failed to find “Dashboard” header in <header>; got concatenated string instead → likely markup issue.; Multi-export test flagged “Invoice date: Invalid Date” – date parsing bug stops dashboard from loading valid data. |
| Internationalisation – language & currency | ❌ fail | Language switcher button (“BETA English”) not found/clickable in multiple tests.; Currency selector not present; user therefore cannot change currency.; Date format test stalled at same language switcher failure – cascading blocker. |
| Responsive design | ❌ pass with visual issues | Only fully-passed suite: desktop → tablet → mobile resizing worked functionally.; However automated UI review repeatedly flagged mis-alignment, inconsistent spacing, unclear hierarchy across breakpoints. |

### Qualitative Improvement Opportunities

Identified areas for UX improvement with rationale and actionable next steps.

| Area | Why It Matters | Next Actions |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| **Missing or incorrectly-labelled DOM elements (e.g., “Bill From :”, “Bill To :”, template names, signature areas)** | Tests – and therefore users – cannot proceed when primary sections are not rendered or are mis-labelled; blocks entire workflow. | • Audit component rendering logic after initial page load – ensure conditional rendering doesn’t hide first-step sections.<br>• Standardise labels/text against design spec so automation & users see the same copy.<br>• Add automated smoke test in CI to fail build if critical selectors are missing. |
| **Form/preview synchronisation** | Real-time feedback is a core value prop; when edits don’t show up, users doubt data accuracy. | • Throttle state updates less aggressively or add debounce; verify two-way binding between form state and preview component.<br>• Add visual loading indicator or toast when preview is out-of-sync. |
| **Visual alignment & spacing (labels, inputs, buttons)** | Repeated ‘looks off’ flags indicate low visual polish, reducing perceived quality and trust. | • Adopt a design-system spacing scale; run layout regression tests at each breakpoint.<br>• Ensure flex/grid containers align items baseline for labels & inputs. |
| **Button & typography consistency** | Inconsistent styles feel unprofessional and hinder discoverability of actions like ‘Generate PDF’. | • Centralise button component with size/colour variants in UI library.<br>• Review global typography tokens for headings, subtitles, body; enforce via linter. |
| **Data validation defaults (e.g., “Invoice date: Invalid Date”)** | Seeing ‘Invalid Date’ immediately undermines confidence in calculations & exports. | • Set sane defaults on new invoice creation (today’s date).<br>• Add front-end date validation before rendering; show placeholder only after user input. |
| **Discoverability of advanced actions (logo upload, currency, language)** | Hidden or absent controls block international users and brand customisation. | • Place ‘Language / Currency’ in persistent header dropdown with clear icon.<br>• Add ‘Upload logo’ CTA inside template preview with hover state.<br>• Provide empty-state hint text guiding user. |
| **Performance / loading feedback** | Many failures are 5 s timeouts; if components load slowly, users need feedback. | • Lazy-load heavy modules but show skeleton loaders.<br>• Measure TTI for wizard step 1; optimise bundle splitting. |

### Priority Action Items

Ranked list of immediate actions to improve the user experience, ordered by impact and feasibility.

1. **Ensure “Step 1 – From & To” sections render immediately with correct h4 text; fixes ~40 % of blocked flows.**
2. **Add language/currency dropdown component to header and verify selectors; unlocks all i18n tests.**
3. **Patch real-time preview binding so edits propagate without refresh; restores core UX promise.**
4. **Implement design-system spacing & label alignment rules; quick CSS pass will remove majority of ‘looks off’ UI flags.**
5. **Default invoice metadata (date, number) to valid values to eliminate ‘Invalid Date’ errors seen in export and dashboard. **
